class emFileModel : public emModel {

public:

	// Abstract base class for a shared file model. Such a file model can
	// represent a file of a certain file format in memory. The most
	// important features are:
	//
	//  - File models can have clients (=> class emFileModelClient). The
	//    clients tell how much memory the model may allocate at most. If
	//    the model would need more, the file is not loaded. Without any
	//    client, the file is never loaded. Thus, if you want a file to be
	//    loaded by a file model, you will have to create and manage at
	//    least one emFileModelClient.
	//
	//  - Loading and unloading is performed automatically, depending on the
	//    the state of the clients.
	//
	//  - Saving is not performed automatically, except a derived class
	//    implements such an automatism.
	//
	//  - Loading and saving are performed step by step in the Cycle method,
	//    so that it does not block the other engines of the program.
	//
	//  - Normally, only one file model is loading at a time (just to avoid
	//    heavy seeking of the hard drive). The order of loading multiple
	//    file models is determined by a priority which can be set at the
	//    clients.
