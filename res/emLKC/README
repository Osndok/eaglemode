What is emLKC?
==============

emLKC is a Linux Kernel Configurator based on Eagle Mode. It allows to configure
the Linux kernel in a zoomable user interface. The minimum supported kernel
version is 3.1.1, and the latest tested version is 3.2.11. emLKC comes as a
kernel source patch. After patching the kernel, you can run it like the original
configurators.


How to patch the kernel
=======================

Here are example commands for applying the patch to a kernel source tree. Please
replace the kernel source directory (/usr/src/linux) and the Eagle Mode
directory (/usr/local/eaglemode) according to your installation.

  cd /usr/src/linux
  bzcat /usr/local/eaglemode/res/emLKC/emLKC.patch.bz2 | patch -p1


How to start emLKC in a patched kernel
======================================

In order to start emLKC, just cd into the kernel source directory and type:

  make emconfig

This tries to find the Eagle Mode installation automatically. If that fails, you
may have to set the variable EM_DIR to the directory where Eagle Mode has been
installed. Example:

  make emconfig EM_DIR=/apps/eaglemode
