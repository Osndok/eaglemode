Eagle Mode is a zoomable user interface (ZUI) with file manager, file viewers,
games, and more.
<P>
This project is about a futuristic style of human-computer interaction, where
the user can visit almost everything simply by zooming in. It features a
portable C++ programming interface for developing such ZUIs, and it features the
Eagle Mode application, which provides a virtual cosmos with plugin
applications.
<P>
The most important one is the professional file manager with its rich,
scriptable command set. It integrates file viewers for most of the common file
types, as well as an audio/video player. Furthermore, the virtual cosmos
contains a chess game, a netwalk game, a 3D mines game, a multi-function clock,
some fractals, and a Linux kernel configurator in form of a kernel patch.
<P>
Eagle Mode runs best on Linux, but there is also a light version for Windows,
which lacks some of the plugins.
<P>
The core of Eagle Mode supports fast anti-aliased graphics, virtually unlimited
depth of zooming, extensive mouse and keyboard control, animated navigation with
kinetic effects (inertia, friction, and magnetism), popup-zoomed control views,
editable bookmarks, in-place help texts, and working with multiple windows.
