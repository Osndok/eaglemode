<H1><A NAME="1"></A>1 Introduction</H1>
This document describes how to customize the commands of the Eagle Mode File
Manager. The commands are made of small script files written in the Perl
programming language. But for simple modifications described below, you do not
need to know anything about Perl.
<P>
The script files are located in the directory
<TT>$EM_DIR/etc/emFileMan/Commands</TT> (replace <TT>$EM_DIR</TT> by the
installation directory of Eagle Mode, and replace etc by etcw if on Windows).
Commands of subgroups are located in corresponding subdirectories. You could
modify the commands directly there, but this may require administrator
privileges. Alternatively, you could create a copy of the whole directory tree,
so that it is possible to modify the files with user privileges. The required
path for that copy is <TT>$HOME/.eaglemode/emFileMan/Commands</TT> (or on
Windows: <TT>%APPDATA%\eaglemode\emFileMan\Commands</TT>). If that directory
exists and seems okay, the script files are loaded from there, and the other is
ignored.
<P>
Adding a new command simply consists of adding a new script file. To make a
change visible to Eagle Mode, trigger the button <I>Reload Files</I>. Error
messages for bad script files are printed to STDERR, and therefore it is a good
idea to run Eagle Mode from a terminal while working on the commands (exception:
on Windows the messages are written to <TT>%TMP%\emCoreBasedAppLog.log</TT>).
<P>
Remember to make backups of your modifications, because they could be removed
when reinstalling Eagle Mode.
<P>
Note: This document describes the UNIX version where the scripts are written in
Perl. On Windows, everything is very similar, but the scripts are in Javascript.

<H1><A NAME="2"></A>2 Simple modifications</H1>

<H2><A NAME="2.1"></A>2.1 Setting the preferred application for a file type</H2>
For example, if you want to make Kate the default text editor, edit the file
<TT>PlainText/Kate.pl</TT> (below the <I>Commands</I> directory described above)
and find the following line in it:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Order = 3.0</TT>
<P>
Simply set the order number to zero:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Order = 0.0</TT>
<P>
Thereby, Kate gets precedence over all the other text editors. And besides, the
button moves to the beginning of the group.

<H2><A NAME="2.2"></A>2.2 Adding a new application for a file type</H2>
Assumed you have an application that can edit or show files of a certain file
type, and you want to be able to run it out of the file manager. Then you have
to create a new file in the desired group directory. Give it a name that ends
with <TT>.pl</TT> and fill it with this template:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#D0D0D0" FGCOLOR="#000000"><TR><TD>
<TT>
#!/usr/bin/perl<BR>
#[[BEGIN PROPERTIES]]<BR>
# Type = Command<BR>
# Order = 0.0<BR>
# Interpreter = perl<BR>
# DefaultFor = </TT><I><B>type</B></I><TT><BR>
# Caption = </TT><I><B>name</B></I><TT><BR>
#[[END PROPERTIES]]<BR>
<BR>
use strict;<BR>
use warnings;<BR>
BEGIN { require "$ENV{'EM_DIR'}/res/emFileMan/scripts/cmd-util.pl"; }<BR>
<BR>
OpenSingleTargetFileWith('</TT><I><B>program</B></I><TT>');<BR>
</TT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<BR>
And then replace three things in the template:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=1>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><I><B>type</B></I></TD>
		<TD>Replace this by the file type the application is able to
		handle. It must be a file name ending including the leading dot
		(something like <TT>.avi</TT>), or a colon-separated list of
		such (e.g. <TT>.avi:.mpg</TT>), or the special keyword
		<TT>file</TT> for the case the application is a plain text
		editor.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><I><B>name</B></I></TD>
		<TD>Replace this by the application name. It is shown in the
		button.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><I><B>program</B></I></TD>
		<TD>Replace this by the executable file name of the application,
		like it is called in a shell, with or without path.</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
If you want to be able to open multiple files at once, and if supported by the
application, you could replace, in the last line of the script, the word
<TT>OpenSingleTargetFileWith</TT> by <TT>OpenTargetFilesWith</TT>.

<H1><A NAME="3"></A>3 Reference</H1>

<H2><A NAME="3.1"></A>3.1 Properties</H2>
Each command script file has a special section containing properties. And for
each command group directory, there is a file which even has such a section. The
properties are configuration parameters read and used by the file manager.
<P>
The format of the properties section is:
<P>
<TT>#[[BEGIN PROPERTIES]]</TT><BR>
<TT>#&nbsp;</TT><I>name</I><TT>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</TT><I>value</I><BR>
<TT>#&nbsp;</TT><I>name</I><TT>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</TT><I>value</I><BR>
<TT>#&nbsp;</TT><I>name</I><TT>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</TT><I>value</I><BR>
<I>...</I><BR>
<TT>#[[END PROPERTIES]]</TT>
<P>
Possible properties are:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=1>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><B>Name</B></TD>
		<TD><B>Description</B></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>Type</TT></TD>
		<TD>Type of the element. Possible values are:<BR>
		<TT>&nbsp;Command&nbsp;</TT>- The file is a command script.<BR>
		<TT>&nbsp;Group&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>- The file describes a
		command group.<BR>
		This property must always be there.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>Order</TT></TD>
		<TD>Order of the element. This can be any number. Within a
		group, the elements are sorted by these numbers. The element
		with the lowest number is at the beginning.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>Interpreter</TT></TD>
		<TD>This property is only for commands. It specifies the program
		to be called as the interpreter for the script. For Perl
		scripts, say <TT>perl</TT>. </TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>Directory</TT></TD>
		<TD>This property is only for groups, and there it is always
		required. It specifies the name (without path) of a subdirectory
		containing the elements of the group.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>DefaultFor</TT></TD>
		<TD>This property is only for commands. It specifies the file
		types for which the command is a default command. The value for
		this property must be one of:
		<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=4>
			<TR VALIGN="top">
				<TD>&nbsp;*</TD>
				<TD>A colon-separated list of file name endings,
				each including the leading dot.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR VALIGN="top">
				<TD>&nbsp;*</TD>
				<TD>The keyword <TT>file</TT>. This means to
				match all regular files.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR VALIGN="top">
				<TD>&nbsp;*</TD>
				<TD>The keyword <TT>directory</TT>. This means
				to match directories.</TD>
			</TR>
		</TABLE>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>Caption</TT></TD>
		<TD>A caption to be shown in the label of the button or
		group.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>Description</TT><BR>or <TT>Descr</TT></TD>
		<TD>A description to be shown in the label of the button or
		group. This property can be given multiple times for creating a
		multi-line description.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>Icon</TT></TD>
		<TD>An icon to be shown in the label of the button or group. It
		can be specified by a file name (without path) of a TGA file in
		the directory <TT>$EM_DIR/res/icons</TT>.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>BgColor<BR>FgColor<BR>ButtonBgColor<BR>ButtonFgColor</TT></TD>
		<TD>Background and foreground colors of the borders and buttons.
		The colors of a group are used as the default for the elements
		of the group. A color can be specified as a color name like
		<TT>Powder Blue</TT>, or as a hexadecimal RGB value like
		<TT>#B0E0E6</TT> or <TT>#BEE</TT>.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>Hotkey</TT></TD>
		<TD>This property specifies a hotkey for the command. Sample
		values are: <TT>Ctrl+C</TT>, <TT>Shift+Alt+D</TT>,
		<TT>Meta+F10</TT></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>BorderScaling</TT></TD>
		<TD>Scale factor for the size of the border. The default is 1.0.
		Zero means to make a group panel unfocusable.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>PrefChildTallness</TT></TD>
		<TD>Preferred height/width ratio of the elements of the group.
		The default is 0.2.</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="3.2"></A>3.2 Precedence of default commands</H2>
By setting the <TT>DefaultFor</TT> property, you can make a command the default
command for a file type. But if multiple commands are the default for the same
file, there is a conflict. In that case, the file manager chooses a command by
the following rules (strongest-first):
<UL>
	<LI>If a command A matches the file by file name ending and a command B
	matches just by matching every file (keyword <TT>file</TT>), then A has
	precedence over B.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>If a command A matches the file by a longer file name ending than a
	command B (e.g. <TT>.tar.gz</TT> vs. <TT>.gz</TT>), then A has
	precedence over B.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>If a command A lies in a parent group (or ancestor group) of the
	group of a command B, then A has precedence over B.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>If a command A has a lower <TT>Order</TT> number than a command B,
	then A has precedence over B.</LI>
</UL>
The rest is tree sorting by captions, case-sensitive.

<H2><A NAME="3.3"></A>3.3 The Perl utility functions</H2>
The original command scripts are implemented in Perl, and the first lines
are always:
<P>
<SMALL><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;use strict;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;use warnings;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BEGIN { require &quot;$ENV{'EM_DIR'}/res/emFileMan/scripts/cmd-util.pl&quot;; }
</TT></SMALL>
<P>
This loads and executes a framework which performs some initializations and
defines a lot of of utility functions. For information about those functions,
please have a look into the file
<TT>$EM_DIR/res/emFileMan/scripts/cmd-util.pl</TT>, and take all the existing
command scripts as usage examples.
<P>
The rest of this document may be of interest only for understanding the
implementation of the framework, or for writing a new framework in another
scripting language.

<H2><A NAME="3.4"></A>3.4 Arguments</H2>
The file manager calls the command scripts with certain arguments: The first
argument is the number of source-selected files and the second argument is the
number of target-selected files. Then there are the absolute paths of the
selected files, with one argument per file, and with the source-selected files
first.

<H2><A NAME="3.5"></A>3.5 Environment variables</H2>
When the file manager calls a command script, following environment variables
are set in addition to normal variables:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=1>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><B>Name</B></TD>
		<TD><B>Description</B></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>EM_DIR</TT></TD>
		<TD>Directory where Eagle Mode has been installed.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT></TD>
		<TD>Contains $EM_DIR/lib, for that the libraries can be found.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>EM_FM_SERVER_NAME</TT></TD>
		<TD>Name of the file manager's emMiniIpc server.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>EM_COMMAND_RUN_ID</TT></TD>
		<TD>An identification for this run of a command.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN="top">
		<TD><TT>EM_X<BR>EM_Y<BR>EM_WIDTH<BR>EM_HEIGHT</TT></TD>
		<TD>Position and size of the application window. This can be
		used to calculate a good position for popup dialogs.</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="3.6"></A>3.6 The file manager's emMiniIpc server</H2>
A command script can send certain requests to the file manager. For doing that,
the script can use the program <TT>emSendMiniIpc</TT> in the directory
<TT>$EM_DIR/bin</TT>. The first argument must be the server name (say
<TT>$EM_FM_SERVER_NAME</TT>), and all further arguments are making up the
request, which can be one of these:
<DL>
	<P>
	<DT><TT>update</TT></DT>
	<DD>Require the file manager to reload all the shown files and
	directories (mostly only if the file modification time has really
	changed).</DD>
	<P>
	<DT><TT>select </TT><I>&lt;command-run-id&gt;</I> [<I>&lt;file&gt;</I>  [<I>&lt;file&gt;</I> ...]]</DT>
	<DD>Like <TT>update</TT>, but also require the file manager to
	target-select the given files, or to clear the target selection if no
	files are given. As usual, the source selection is set to the old target
	selection. The <I>&lt;command-run-id&gt;</I> must be set to the value
	given with the environment variable <TT>EM_COMMAND_RUN_ID</TT>. The
	sense of that id is: If the user has modified the selection since the
	file manager command has been started, or if another command has been
	started afterwards, the selection request is ignored automatically.</DD>
	<P>
	<DT><TT>selectks </TT><I>&lt;command-run-id&gt;</I> [<I>&lt;file&gt;</I>  [<I>&lt;file&gt;</I> ...]]</DT>
	<DD>Like above, but the source selection is not changed (ks = keep
	source).</DD>
	<P>
	<DT><TT>selectcs </TT><I>&lt;command-run-id&gt;</I> [<I>&lt;file&gt;</I>  [<I>&lt;file&gt;</I> ...]]</DT>
	<DD>Like above, but the source selection is cleared (cs = clear
	source).</DD>
</DL>
