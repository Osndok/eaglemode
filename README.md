First of all, please have a look at the following links
 - Eagle Mode original [project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eaglemode/) (â„¹ hosted from sourceforge.net),

Now that all attribution and credits is clear,
we can move on to the next part which is only
about making it a little bit easier for /me
to install Eagle Mode for a linux distribution,
namely Ubuntu, and only the latest LTS release at this moment.

`lsb_release -a` outputs
